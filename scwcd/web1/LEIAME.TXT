 INSTALLATION
 
 It is a one or two step process.
 
 FIRST. You have to create a server. Go to Navigator and then New->Server. 
 Then select Apache and specifically Tomcat 5.5 (that´s the version 
 I am using). My Tomcat installation makes use of connector 8443, 
 so you need the second step below. Otherwise, the environment is ready.
 
 SECOND. Select Servers, Tomcat v5.5 and the file 'server.xml' on 
 Project Explorer. Search for connector on port 8443. You must change 
 the property 'keystoreFile' to a valid keystore file. There is one, just
 for development, in Tomcat root dir with the name 'keystore'. 
 
 THIRD. Possibly you will need to go to Window->Preferences->Server and
 select Installed Runtimes. At this moment you can define the path of the
 server (Tomcat).
